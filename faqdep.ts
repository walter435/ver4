    question: `Can I request a withdrawal if my account has a negative balance?`,
    answer: `No. Withdrawals are only permitted within your 'Available Balance'; if your balance is negative, you must first restore it to above zero.

[Summary]
- Calculation: Available funds are calculated as [Balance-Required Margin-Unrealized Loss]. A negative balance means there are no funds available for withdrawal.

- Causes of Negative Balance: This may occur during extreme market volatility or liquidity gaps; in such cases, you must restore the balance through deposits or adjustments.

    question: `How should I choose the wallet network (ERC20, TRC20, etc.) when withdrawing cryptocurrency?`,
    answer: `The most critical factor is selecting the exact same network supported by the receiving wallet address.

[Summary]
- Network Characteristics:
 1. ERC20 (Ethereum): secure and stable, but gas fees can rise during congestion.
 2. TRC20 (TRON): Fast and features very low fees, ideal for frequent or small transfers.
 3. BEP20 (BNB Chain): Offers very low fees and high speed, commonly used for exchange transfers.

- Double Check: help the network matches the recipient's wallet. Choosing the wrong network may result in the permanent loss of your assets.

- Client Responsibility: Blockchain transactions are irreversible; you are responsible for ensuring all details are correct before confirming.

- Test Transfer: For your safety, we recommend sending a small test amount before proceeding with a large withdrawal.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Deposit & Withdrawals`,
    question: `If I enter the wrong wallet address during withdrawal, can the funds be recovered?`,
    answer: `No. Due to the irreversible nature of blockchain, transactions cannot be canceled or reversed once processed, and funds sent to the wrong address are unrecoverable.

[Summary]
- Irreversibility: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain ledger, it is final. No third party has the authority or technical means to undo it.

- Loss of Assets: If the funds are sent to a valid but unintended address, they cannot be retrieved without the recipient's consent, resulting in potential permanent loss.

- Verification Priority: Systems check for address format validity, not recipient identity. You must verify every character of the address before finalizing the request.

- Best Practices: Use copy-paste functions and conduct a small test transfer before moving large amounts to help the address is correct and active.`,

    question: `How can I check if a deposit/withdrawal request is delayed?`,
    answer: `First, please log in to the MIM Client Portal to check the real-time status (e.g., Pending, Processing) of your request.

[Summary]
- Status Check: "Pending" indicates the request is received, while "Processing" means it is awaiting bank or network confirmation. You can view these stages in the portal.

- Identifying Causes: International wires (SWIFT) may be delayed by intermediary banks, national regulations, or holidays. Crypto transfers depend on blockchain network traffic.

- Inquiry: If the status remains unchanged beyond the expected timeframe, contact Customer Support to verify if there are any issues with the payment network or banking system.

- Monitoring: MIM monitors all networks 24/7. If a delay occurs due to external system factors, we provide clear information regarding the cause to keep you informed.`,

  {
    category: `Deposit & Withdrawals`,
    question: `What are the most common causes of withdrawal delays?`,
    answer: `Withdrawal delays typically occur due to banking processing systems, blockchain network congestion, or compliance verification procedures.

[Summary]
- Bank Wire Processing: International transfers (SWIFT) take 1–5 business days via intermediary banks. Delays can be caused by weekends, holidays, time zone differences, or bank cut-off times.

- Blockchain Congestion: Crypto withdrawals depend on network traffic (ERC20, TRC20, etc.). During high-volume periods, transaction confirmations on the ledger may take longer than usual.

- Enhanced KYC/AML Checks: For high-value or unusual activity, the Compliance team may require additional verification or proof of funds (EDD), temporarily holding the request for review.

- Account & Margin Conditions: Withdrawals may be restricted due to open positions, insufficient free margin, or unfulfilled bonus terms within the account.`,

    category: `Deposit & Withdrawals`,
    question: `Is 2FA authentication mandatory for deposits and withdrawals?`,
    answer: `While 2FA is not a strict legal requirement, it is recommended as an important security measure to protect your assets.

[Summary]
- Enhanced Security: Enabling 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) requires an extra verification step (like an OTP), significantly reducing the risk of fund leakage due to hacking or unauthorized access.

- Withdrawal Safeguard: Even if your password is compromised, 2FA prevents unauthorized withdrawal requests by requiring a second authentication code, blocking phishing and account takeover attempts.

- High-Value & Unusual Activity: For large withdrawals or logins from unrecognized devices, 2FA acts as a critical safety net to re-verify your identity.

- Recommendation: MIM encourages all clients to enable 2FA for withdrawals and key account activities. It takes only a few minutes to set up but provides one of the most effective layers of defense for your funds.`,

    question: `What happens if the depositor’s name does not match the account holder’s registered name in a bank transfer deposit?`,
    answer: `Deposits from third-party accounts are rejected under AML regulations and will not be credited to your trading account.

[Summary]
- Automatic Rejection: To comply with international financial standards, any funds sent from a name that does not match the registered account holder will be rejected.

- Manual Review & Refund: If a name mismatch is detected during manual review (e.g., in international wires), the funds will be refunded to the original source rather than being deposited.

- Account Restrictions: Repeated attempts to use third-party names may lead to account suspension or requests for additional identity verification (KYC) per security policies.

- Smooth Transactions: Always use payment methods registered in your own name to avoid unnecessary delays or administrative restrictions on your account.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Deposit & Withdrawals`,
    question: `If I send cryptocurrency to the wrong deposit network, can it be refunded?`,
    answer: `No. Due to the nature of blockchain, funds sent via the wrong network are unrecognized by the receiving account and are practically unrecoverable.

[Summary]
- Irreversibility: Blockchain transactions cannot be reversed once broadcast. Sending via an incorrect network may show as "completed" on the ledger, but the funds will not reach your MIM account.

- No Recovery: For instance, sending TRC20 assets to an ERC20- only address locks the funds in an incompatible network context where they cannot be retrieved by MIM or any third party.

- Double-Check: Before transferring, help that both the recipient wallet address and the selected network type (e.g., ERC20, TRC20) match exactly.

- Small Test First: For large amounts, we strongly recommend a small test transfer to verify that the funds are correctly reflected before sending the full balance.`,

    question: `Withdrawing bonus credits`,
    answer: `Bonus credits are additional assets provided to support your trading activities. In principle, they cannot be unconditionally converted into cash for withdrawal. However, profits generated using the bonus can be withdrawn once specific requirements are met.

[Summary]
- Withdrawal Restriction Principle: Bonus credits are intended to support actual trading. To maintain a fair environment and prevent abuse, they cannot be immediately converted into cash.

- Withdrawal Eligibility Conditions: To withdraw profits generated from bonuses, the following conditions must typically be met:

 1. Turnover Requirements: You must reach a specified minimum trading volume (lots).

 2. Minimum Holding Period: You must maintain the account and continue trading for a certain period after the bonus is issued.

 3. Promotion-Specific Policies: Since conditions vary by promotion, you must check the specific terms and conditions provided at the time of issuance.

- Important Notices: Activities that contradict the purpose of the bonus system may be subject to restrictions.

 1. Using bonuses solely for the purpose of cash conversion rather than actual trading is prohibited.

 2. If requirements are not met at the time of a withdrawal request, the request may be rejected or the bonus may be voided.

MIM transparently discloses all bonus-related terms, and you can receive detailed guidance regarding your withdrawal eligibility through our customer support team.`,

    question: `Account balance deducted after a withdrawal request`,
    answer: `No, it is normal. To prevent double withdrawals or duplicate fund usage, the requested amount is immediately deducted and set to "Withdrawal Pending" status.

[Summary]
- Prevent Duplicates: This measure prevents the same funds from being withdrawn twice or being used as trading margin after a withdrawal request has been made.

- Real-time Balance Update: Immediate deduction allows you to accurately track your available balance for new trades or additional transactions.

- common practice: This procedure follows financial regulations and AML standards to help the transparency and security of client assets.
