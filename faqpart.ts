    question: `Are both CPA and Rebate models supported?`,
    answer: `Yes, MIM supports both CPA and Rebate models, allowing partners to choose the compensation structure that best suits their business strategy and client characteristics.

[Supported Models and Features]
- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): A one- time fixed payment is made when a referred client meets specific criteria, such as a first deposit. This offers immediate rewards regardless of the client's long- term activity, making it ideal for partners focused on acquisition.

- Rebate (Volume- Based Rewards): Commissions are paid continuously based on the trading volume of referred clients. As clients trade more, earnings accumulate, making this model perfect for partners seeking stable, long- term passive income.

- Flexibility of Choice: Partners can select between the immediate returns of CPA or the sustainable income of Rebates, or negotiate a structure that optimizes their revenue model.`,

    category: `Partners`,
    question: `When are IB commissions settled and in which currencies are they paid?`,
    answer: `IB commissions are settled on a weekly or monthly basis, with payments typically made in globally accepted currencies like USD or USDT.

[Settlement and Payment Details]
- Settlement Cycle: Partners usually start with a monthly cycle. However, as trading volume increases or partnership tiers rise, you may switch to weekly payouts for better cash flow management.

- Payout Currency: Payments are standardly made in USD (US Dollar) for stability. Additionally, USDT (Tether) is widely favored for its speed and low transaction fees in cross- border settlements.

- Transparent Management: You can track accrued commissions and pending payouts in real- time via the partner dashboard. All transactions are transparently recorded, and data can be exported to Excel for tax reporting or bookkeeping.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can an IB re- register after contract termination?`,
    answer: `Yes, re- registration is possible in principle. Even after a contract has been terminated, IBs may apply to register again. However, approval depends heavily on the specific reason for termination and MIM’s internal policies.

[Criteria and Review for Re- registration]
- Termination due to Inactivity: If the contract was terminated simply because there was no new client acquisition or trading activity for a certain period, re- registration is generally allowed upon request.

- Severity of Breach: While minor breaches may be reconsidered after review, cases involving serious violations—such as false advertising, involvement with client funds, or AML breaches—make re- registration practically impossible.

- Mandatory Review: Re- registration is not automatic. All requests undergo a strict compliance review by MIM, and approval is granted only if the ability to restore trust is demonstrated.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What is the payout cycle for IB commissions?`,
    answer: `IB commission payouts are typically processed on a weekly or monthly basis. Generally, new partners start with monthly payouts, with the structure allowing for a switch to weekly payouts based on performance.

[Payout Cycles and Features]
- Standard Cycle: Most new IBs begin with 'Monthly Payouts' to ensure a stable settlement structure and to allow for the monitoring of initial activities.

- Benefits of Shorter Cycles: Upon achieving a certain trading volume or performance level, partners are offered the option to switch to 'Weekly Payouts.' This improves cash flow, making it easier to reinvest in marketing and cover operational expenses.

- Flexible Policy: MIM adjusts payout cycles based on partner reliability and performance. High- performing partners are supported with faster liquidity to help accelerate their business expansion.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can an IB partner with multiple brokers at the same time?`,
    answer: `Yes, generally speaking. Most brokers in the industry allow IBs to maintain simultaneous partnerships with multiple firms. This flexibility enables IBs to offer a wider range of products and trading conditions to their clients. However, there are several key considerations.

[Allowances and Key Considerations]
- Check Exclusivity: Some brokers may require exclusivity agreements for certain regions or marketing activities, so it is essential to review contract terms carefully.

- Conflict and Brand Management: Recommending multiple brokers to the same client or aggressively comparing competitors can cause confusion and may dilute your professional brand image and credibility.

- Compliance Complexity: Managing multiple partnerships requires strict adherence to the individual reporting obligations, settlement procedures, and KYC requirements of each broker.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is there a training program for new IBs?`,
    answer: `Yes. MIM provides a dedicated training program designed to help new partners adapt quickly and operate effectively. This program goes beyond simple orientation to build practical skills.

[Training Methods and Content]
- Diverse Channels: We support various learning methods, including webinars, online lectures, comprehensive manuals, and 1:1 orientation sessions when needed.

- Core Curriculum: The training covers essential topics such as compliance rules (AML/KYC obligations, advertising standards), practical client acquisition strategies (digital marketing, social media usage), and detailed guides on using the partner portal.

- Purpose: This training is an investment in our long- term partnership, aimed at helping IBs minimize trial and error and achieve faster results.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `How is IB income calculated?`,
    answer: `IB income is primarily calculated based on the trading costs incurred by clients, such as spreads (the difference between bid and ask prices) or trading commissions. MIM allocates a certain percentage of these fees to the IB, following the standard revenue- sharing model in the financial industry.

[Key Features of the Revenue Structure]
- Revenue Principle: A portion of the spread or commission generated from client trades is accumulated as IB income. As long as clients continue to trade, commissions continue to accrue.

- Independence from P/L: A key feature is that IB income is independent of the client's trading results (profit or loss). Whether the client gains or loses, the IB receives commissions as long as a trade is executed.

- Volume- Based Growth: Consequently, IB income is proportional to the number of active clients and their trading volume, rather than trading performance. The more active clients you attract, the more stable and substantial your revenue becomes.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What procedures are required to start an IB partnership?`,
    answer: `The MIM IB partnership follows a streamlined and transparent process. From online application to tool access, our systematic approach ensures partners can start their activities quickly.

[Step- by- Step Procedure]
- Application & Submission: Complete the online application form on the MIM website and submit required documents, such as ID, proof of residence, and contact details. Depending on regional regulations, additional tax or bank information may be required.

- Internal Review: MIM verifies the applicant’s identity and submitted documents. This review typically takes 1–2 business days, though it may take longer in regions with stricter regulatory requirements.

- Approval & Launch: Once approved, you gain access to a dedicated partner portal and a unique tracking link. Through the portal, you can monitor real- time performance, manage earnings, download marketing materials, and immediately begin client acquisition activities.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can IBs directly provide rebates to clients?`,
    answer: `Yes, at MIM, IBs are permitted to share a portion of their earned commission with clients (rebates) to provide additional benefits. This can be an effective strategy to build client loyalty. However, to ensure transparency, prior approval is mandatory.

[Guidelines and Precautions]
- Purpose of Permission: Partners may share part of their commission to offer clients added value, thereby encouraging trading activity and maintaining long- term relationships.

- Compliance (Approval Required): To prevent market distortion, all rebate schemes must be reviewed and approved by MIM in advance. Excessive cash incentives or illegal solicitation practices that violate regulations are strictly prohibited.

- Strategic Use: Beyond direct cash refunds, we recommend diversifying benefits through trading fee discounts, free access to educational materials, or promotional credits to enhance your competitiveness.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is the IB contract period fixed, or is it maintained indefinitely?`,
    answer: `MIM’s IB contracts are generally structured as "indefinite agreements" with no specific expiration date. This allows partners to build a business and manage clients with a long- term perspective. However, maintaining the contract requires adherence to certain activity standards.

[Contract Terms and Conditions]
- Basic Principle: Following industry standards, contracts are signed indefinitely without a fixed end date, enabling partners to build a stable revenue model without time constraints.

- Conditions for Maintenance: "Indefinite" does not mean "unconditional." The contract may be reviewed or terminated in cases of prolonged inactivity, regulatory violations, or abnormal marketing practices.

- Performance- Based Adjustments: Contract terms may be renegotiated if there are no new clients or trading volume over a certain period. Conversely, partners with outstanding performance may be rewarded with better commission rates and long- term benefits.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can IB activities be restricted depending on regulatory authorities?`,
    answer: `Yes. IB activities can be restricted or even prohibited depending on the policies of financial regulatory authorities in each country. Since IBs are viewed not just as marketing partners but as channels for financial promotion, regulations are applied strictly.

[Regulatory Status by Region]
- Prohibited or Strictly Restricted: Countries like the United States (CFTC/NFA), Japan (FSA), South Korea (FSC), and certain EU nations (under ESMA) strictly prohibit or restrict unauthorized IB activities.

- Regulated (License Required): Jurisdictions such as Australia (ASIC), Singapore (MAS), and Hong Kong (SFC) allow IB activities but often require specific licenses or registration procedures.

- Relatively Flexible: Offshore jurisdictions like Seychelles and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) tend to apply more flexible rules.

- IB Obligations: IBs are considered financial marketing channels subject to regulation. Therefore, before commencing operations, IBs must verify the legal framework of their target region and ensure they operate strictly within lawful boundaries.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What is the difference between an IB and a regular trader?`,
    answer: `A regular trader invests personal capital to seek market profits and bears full responsibility for profits and losses. In contrast, an IB focuses on client acquisition and management without direct trading, earning stable commissions based on client trading volume.

[Key Differences]
- Revenue Model: A trader’s income depends on market analysis and trade timing, whereas an IB’s income is driven by networking skills and client trading volume. A key distinction is that IBs earn commissions whenever trades occur, regardless of whether the client makes a profit or loss.

- Risk Management: Traders always face the risk of capital loss due to market volatility. However, IBs face no direct market risk and can build a stable business model through marketing activities.

- Core Competencies: Traders require financial knowledge and technical trading skills, while IBs rely more on networking, marketing, and long- term client relationship management.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Who is responsible for handling disputes with clients?`,
    answer: `MIM bears full responsibility for resolving all official disputes and complaints arising with clients. As the licensed financial service provider, MIM is legally accountable, while IBs serve strictly as intermediaries without legal liability for dispute resolution.

[Division of Responsibility and Roles]
- MIM’s Sole Responsibility: MIM is legally and operationally responsible for all core services, including account opening, trade execution, and fund custody. Therefore, disputes regarding trading conditions or withdrawals are investigated and resolved directly by MIM’s dedicated departments.

- IB’s Exemption: IBs are marketing partners focused on acquisition and basic support. Since they do not handle client funds or execute trades, they bear no legal liability for financial disputes.

- Bridging Role: However, as the primary point of contact, IBs act as a communication bridge. Their role is to promptly relay client concerns to MIM to facilitate a smooth and quick resolution.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can individuals participate in the IB program, or is it only for corporations?`,
    answer: `The MIM IB program is designed with an open structure that welcomes both individuals and corporations. Partners can choose the type that best suits their goals and business circumstances.

[Participation Types and Features]
- Individual Partners: With low entry barriers, registration requires only simple identity verification (KYC) and proof of residence. This option offers flexibility and is ideal for retail traders, marketers, and educators who wish to start quickly.

- Corporate Partners: This option requires additional documentation, such as a business license and certificate of incorporation. Corporate partners benefit from higher brand credibility, tax advantages, and scalability, making it suitable for large- scale operations.

- Regulatory Note: While most regions support both types, strict financial regulations in certain countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, Korea) may restrict individual participation or allow only corporate entities. Please verify local regulations beforehand.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What are the requirements for starting IB activities?`,
    answer: `While the conditions for starting IB activities are relatively simple compared to other financial licenses, basic credibility and client acquisition capabilities are essential.

[Three Essential Requirements]
- Mandatory Verification (KYC): Whether you are an individual or a corporation, submitting documents such as ID and proof of residence is mandatory. This ensures compliance with Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and international financial regulations.

- Marketing Foundation over Capital: There is no requirement for initial capital. Instead, possessing a solid foundation for client acquisition, such as trading communities, educational platforms, or online channels, is far more important.

- Adherence to Guidelines: Partners must follow the marketing guidelines and training provided by MIM to prevent unethical practices. Compliance is vital for maintaining long- term client trust and a sustainable partnership.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can IBs check performance and commissions in real time?`,
    answer: `Yes, they can. MIM provides a dedicated portal where partners can monitor their performance and accrued commissions in real- time. This feature is essential for ensuring transparency and operational efficiency.

[Real- Time Data and Management Features]
- Real- Time Monitoring: Key metrics such as client trading volume, generated rebates, and new account openings are reflected immediately in the portal. This allows partners to instantly assess marketing effectiveness and adjust strategies.

- Transparency and Reliability: All data is automatically aggregated via MIM’s trading servers and CRM system. This automation minimizes the risk of manipulation or error, ensuring a completely transparent settlement process.

- Long- Term Management: Beyond real- time tracking, the portal offers historical data analysis tools, enabling partners to compare monthly or quarterly results for systematic business planning.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `How does MIM manage the relationship between IBs and clients?`,
    answer: `MIM systematically manages the relationship between IBs and clients through its dedicated CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.

[Role of CRM and Management Method]
- Automatic Tracking: When a client registers, the system automatically records the referring IB. This data serves as the core basis for accurate commission calculations and rebate payouts.

- Transparent Performance Tracking: IBs can access limited data—such as client lists, account status, trading volume, and generated commissions—via the CRM. This allows for objective measurement of marketing performance and transparent revenue tracking.

- Dispute Prevention and Trust: Since all relationships are digitally recorded, the system prevents disputes over double claims or unfair compensation. Furthermore, access to sensitive client information is strictly restricted to ensure privacy and compliance.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can an IB handle deposits or withdrawals on behalf of clients?`,
    answer: `No. Under no circumstances is an IB allowed to directly handle or process client funds (deposits or withdrawals). This is strictly prohibited across the global financial industry to comply with Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and anti- fraud regulations.

[Prohibitions and Role Limitations]
- Strict Prohibition: All fund transfers must be executed exclusively through accounts verified under the client’s own name. Handling client funds or accessing client accounts to request withdrawals is considered "third- party funding" and is strictly blocked.

- Role Limitation: The IB’s role is limited to providing guidance and education on how to use the deposit/withdrawal system. You must never accept cash from clients to deposit on their behalf or access their accounts.

- Consequences of Violation: Any involvement in handling client funds is treated as money laundering or embezzlement. Such actions will result in immediate termination of the partnership contract and potential legal penalties.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Do I need prior approval from MIM to conduct marketing activities?`,
    answer: `Yes. To ensure regulatory compliance and maintain brand credibility, most brokers, including MIM, require prior approval for major marketing activities.

[Approval Scope and Procedures]
- Activities Requiring Approval: Major initiatives such as creating websites, running paid social media ad campaigns, or hosting large offline seminars require submitting detailed plans and promotional materials to the Compliance team for review and approval.

- Autonomous Activities: Personal blog posts or simple referral link sharing are relatively flexible. However, even these activities must strictly adhere to brand guidelines and legal standards (e.g., no false or misleading claims).

- Consequences of Violation: Conducting unapproved marketing campaigns can lead to severe consequences, including contract termination, forfeiture of accrued commissions, and potential legal sanctions. Therefore, strict adherence to the approval process is essential.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Are IB programs restricted in certain countries?`,
    answer: `Yes, IB activities may be restricted depending on the financial regulatory environment of each country. This is a mandatory measure to ensure compliance with local laws and licensing requirements, not just MIM’s internal policy.

[Regulations and Precautions]
- Regulatory Restrictions: In heavily regulated regions such as the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and parts of the EU, IB activities regarding derivative products may be prohibited or require specific local licenses.

- Restricted Countries List: Brokers maintain a "Restricted Countries List" to manage legal risks. Partners must confirm whether their target region is permitted for operation before commencing activities.

- Compliance Obligations: Even in regions with lighter regulations, partners must strictly adhere to international standards such as Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC). Violations may result in penalties or contract termination.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can an IB directly collect or store client information?`,
    answer: `No. Under global privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, and in accordance with financial regulations, IBs are strictly prohibited from directly collecting or storing sensitive client information. This rule is in place to enhance data security and prevent legal disputes.

[Data Management Principles and Restrictions]
- Exclusive Management by MIM: All client data is managed exclusively within MIM’s official, secure CRM system.

- Limited Access: Information visible to IBs is strictly limited to data necessary for tracking performance, such as client names, account activity status, trading volume, and commission records. Sensitive details like contact information, ID documents, and specific deposit/withdrawal or trading history remain inaccessible.

- Reasoning: This structure minimizes the risk of data leaks (hacking or internal misuse) and clarifies that full responsibility for data protection lies with the broker (MIM). Any unauthorized collection or storage of client data by an IB is a serious violation subject to legal penalties.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What are the reasons an IB may be disqualified?`,
    answer: `IB qualifications are maintained based on trust. If serious misconduct is identified, immediate disqualification may occur, potentially leading to forfeiture of earnings and a permanent ban on future partnerships.

[Key Reasons for Disqualification]
- False or Misleading Advertising: Making unrealistic promises such as "risk- free trading" or "guaranteed profits," or using distorted materials to attract clients, will result in immediate sanctions.

- Unauthorized Fund or Account Involvement: Handling deposits/withdrawals on behalf of clients or accessing client accounts to trade constitutes AML violations and illegal asset management, leading to permanent disqualification.

- Regulatory and Policy Violations: Conducting unauthorized marketing in restricted regions, offering unapproved rebates, or causing repeated client complaints due to improper guidance are grounds for contract termination and loss of IB status.`,

    question: `How does MIM support and manage IBs?`,
    answer: `MIM regards IBs not merely as affiliates but as strategic partners driving growth and market expansion. To ensure stable and sustainable performance, we operate a comprehensive support system and a structured management framework.

[Key Support and Management Systems]
- Dedicated Support: We operate a specialized IB support team with real- time communication channels to promptly address any inquiries or requests.

- Tools and Transparency: We provide a real- time performance dashboard and a transparent settlement system, enabling IBs to objectively manage their results and clearly track their earnings.

  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Does MIM provide dedicated marketing materials for IBs?`,
    answer: `Yes. MIM provides a wide range of dedicated marketing materials to ensure IBs can conduct smooth and professional client acquisition activities. This support is essential for maintaining brand consistency and compliance.

[Available Materials and Features]
- Comprehensive Digital & Offline Assets: We provide standard digital tools (banners, email templates, tracking links) as well as offline materials (seminar slides, brochures, posters) to cover all marketing channels.

- Compliance and Credibility: All provided materials are pre- approved, strictly adhering to MIM’s brand guidelines and financial regulations. Using these official assets ensures safety and professionalism without the need for separate compliance reviews.

- Customization Options: We also support the creation of customized materials, such as tailored landing pages or reports, upon request. Utilizing these resources significantly increases efficiency and helps convey trust to potential clients.`,

    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What kind of educational or support services can an IB provide?`,
    answer: `IBs can provide various educational and support services to help clients understand the platform and start trading smoothly.

[Permissible Services and Limitations]
- Education and Guides: You can host seminars or webinars to explain platform usage, order methods (e.g., MT5 installation), and account management procedures, or distribute manuals and FAQs to assist new clients.

- Marketing and Information Sharing: It is permitted to use MIM- approved official marketing materials to build credibility and share public market information, such as economic calendars or news summaries.

- Limitations (No Investment Advice): However, offering specific buy/sell recommendations or asset management advice is restricted to licensed professionals. IBs must act strictly as guides and supporters; unauthorized investment advisory activities are strictly prohibited.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can an IB manage a client’s account?`,
    answer: `No. Under no circumstances can an IB directly manage a client’s account or execute trades on their behalf. This is a fundamental rule in the global financial industry to protect client assets.

[Restrictions on Authority and Role Definition]
- Prohibition of Managed Accounts: Authority over trade execution (opening/closing positions) and fund management belongs solely to the client. Intervention by an IB is considered "unauthorized asset management" and is strictly prohibited by major global regulators (e.g., ESMA, NFA).

- Proper Role of IB: An IB's role is limited to indirect support rather than direct management. This includes explaining platform usage, providing market news, offering educational materials, and sharing general trading guidelines.

- Legal Consequences: Logging into a client's account or trading on their behalf is a serious violation. Such actions can lead to legal sanctions and liability for any resulting client losses.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `In what ways can IB commissions be paid — card, e- wallet, or bank transfer?`,
    answer: `MIM supports various payment methods, including bank transfers, e- wallets, and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing partners to choose the most convenient option based on their location and preference.

[Payment Methods and Features]
- Bank Wire Transfer: The traditional method where funds are sent directly to your bank account. While universally available, it may take 2–5 business days to process and incur intermediary bank fees.

- E- Wallets: Services like Skrill and Neteller offer faster processing times and relatively lower fees, making them a popular choice. However, availability may be restricted in certain countries.

- Crypto Wallets: Using cryptocurrencies like USDT is becoming the industry standard due to its speed (processed within minutes) and low transaction fees. Caution is advised when selecting wallet addresses and networks.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is it mandatory for an IB to be a registered corporation?`,
    answer: `No. MIM supports both Individual and Corporate partnerships, so corporate registration is not a mandatory requirement. You can choose the structure that best suits your business scale and strategy.

[Features and Selection Guide]
- Individual IB: Registration requires only personal identification (KYC) and proof of residence. This option has a lower entry barrier and is ideal for small- scale operations or those starting with online marketing.

- Corporate IB: Requires submission of business registration and corporate documents. This is advantageous for large- scale partnership contracts, operating offline branches, or managing specific tax requirements.

- General Growth Path: It is common for IBs to start as individuals and transition to a corporate structure as their client base and revenue grow. However, please check local regulations, as some jurisdictions may strictly require corporate status.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Where can I check my earnings details?`,
    answer: `You can transparently review all your earnings details through the dedicated partner portal (dashboard) provided after approval. This system serves as a core tool for real- time monitoring of revenue and client activity.

[Key Features]
- Real- Time Monitoring: The dashboard automatically records detailed metrics, including trading volume per client, generated commissions, payment status, and pending earnings, allowing for immediate verification.

- Guaranteed Transparency: Beyond just total revenue, you can clearly track exactly which clients traded and how commissions were calculated, ensuring there is no ambiguity in the settlement process.

- Data Management: For tax reporting or internal accounting, you can download all recorded data as an Excel file for your records and analysis.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is IB registration only possible online?`,
    answer: `Yes, conducting registration via online portals is the global industry standard for most brokers, including MIM. This eliminates geographical barriers and allows for quick partnership establishment from anywhere in the world.

[Benefits of Online Registration and Management]
- Standardized Process: Registration is completed simply by filling out an online form and uploading required documents (ID, proof of residence) on the dedicated website, removing the need for physical visits.

- Speed and Transparency: The online system ensures fast and transparent processing of applications and document reviews. Partners can begin their activities immediately upon approval.

- Digital Management System: Once approved, partners gain access to an online dashboard. This tool allows for real- time monitoring of client traffic, commission calculations based on trading volume, and settlement details to optimize revenue.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `If a client does not deposit or withdraw, will IB earnings still occur?`,
    answer: `No, they will not. IB earnings are generated solely based on the client's actual trading activity. Even if an account is successfully opened, no commission is generated without a deposit and subsequent trading.

[Prerequisites for Earnings]
- Trading is Mandatory: Following global industry standards, IB commissions are derived from the spreads or fees generated when clients execute actual orders. Thus, 'deposit and trading execution' are the starting points for revenue, not just sign- ups.

- No Deposit, No Income: If a client merely holds an account without funding it (dormant status), no revenue is generated. Even CPA programs require clients to meet minimum deposit or trading volume criteria to qualify for rewards.

- Core Role of IB: Therefore, an IB’s role goes beyond mere recruitment; it focuses on retention—supporting clients to ensure they fund their accounts and trade consistently.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Can IBs run their own advertising campaigns?`,
    answer: `Yes, IBs are permitted to run their own advertising campaigns to expand client acquisition. However, these activities must strictly adhere to the broker’s official guidelines and local regulatory standards.

[Conditions and Requirements]
- Guideline Compliance: All advertisements must align with MIM’s brand policies and financial regulations.

- Pre- Approval Process: Any self- produced advertising material must be submitted to MIM’s Compliance team for review and approval before publication.

- Autonomy and Responsibility: While IBs have the freedom to utilize various marketing channels, all activities must remain transparent and legally compliant. Running unapproved ads or using non- compliant content constitutes a serious breach and may result in contract termination.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is it legally problematic to operate as an Individual IB?`,
    answer: `No. Operating as an Individual IB is generally not legally problematic in most countries. In fact, many global brokers allow individual registration with just ID verification (KYC). However, strictly adhering to legal obligations is essential to ensure compliance.

[Key Considerations and Legal Obligations]
- Tax Reporting Obligations: Income generated as an Individual IB is subject to personal income tax under local laws. You must declare and pay taxes faithfully; failure to do so may be considered tax evasion.

- Regulatory Environment: While generally permitted, some jurisdictions with strict financial regulations may classify IB activities as financial marketing, imposing restrictions. It is important to check local laws.

- Scope of Liability: Unlike corporations, individual IBs may have fewer legal protections. Therefore, as your revenue grows, transitioning to a corporate structure is a common step to enhance credibility and manage legal risks more systematically.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Are the contract terms between IB and MIM disclosed or kept confidential?`,
    answer: `IB contracts are private agreements between MIM and the IB and are, in principle, kept strictly confidential. This is an industry standard designed to protect the business interests and strategic conditions of both parties.

[Confidentiality Principles and Exceptions]
- Non- Disclosure Agreement (NDA): Most contracts include an NDA clause. This is intended to protect MIM’s strategic pricing policies and the IB’s unique commission terms from being exposed to competitors or third parties, thereby maintaining market trust.

- Exceptions and Consequences: Contract terms are not disclosed except in mandatory cases such as regulatory requests, legal disputes, or audits. Unauthorized disclosure to third parties is considered a strict violation of the contract and may result in penalties, so caution is required.`,
  },
  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Is there a dedicated portal for IBs?`,
    answer: `Yes, MIM provides a dedicated IB Portal to all partners. This is not just an administrative tool but a core platform that allows IBs to transparently track, analyze, and manage their performance.

[Key Features]
- Real- Time Monitoring: You can monitor client inflows, account openings, trading volumes, generated commissions, and settlement progress in real- time.

- Revenue Management & Reporting: Commission calculations are automatically recorded, and payment schedules are clearly displayed. The portal also supports data downloads in Excel format for accounting and analysis purposes.

- Transparency and Reliability: All data within the portal is directly linked to the broker’s CRM and trading servers, making manipulation impossible. This ensures that IBs can fully trust their performance and revenue data.`,

    question: `What is the MIM IB Partnership Program and what role does it play?`,
    answer: `The IB (Introducing Broker) program is a core partnership model widely used in the global financial industry, serving as a bridge connecting MIM with clients.

[Key Roles and Structure]
- Division of Roles: IBs do not engage in direct trading but focus on client acquisition, education, and consultation. Meanwhile, MIM handles trade execution, fund management, platform operations, and risk management.

- Revenue Structure: IBs earn a portion of the spread or commission generated when their clients execute trades. This structure allows for consistent income growth as trading volume increases.

- Operational Efficiency: By allowing IBs to focus on marketing and support while MIM manages operations and funds, the partnership ensures high expertise and provides a trustworthy service experience for clients.`,

  {
    category: `Partners`,
    question: `Are there additional verification procedures for high- value settlements?`,
    answer: `Yes. In compliance with Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, most global brokers, including MIM, require mandatory additional verification for settlements exceeding a certain amount. This is an industry standard to adhere to international financial laws.

[Criteria and Procedures]
- Thresholds and Documents: Typically, for withdrawals exceeding $10,000, partners may be required to undergo re- verification and submit documents such as Proof of Source of Funds or bank statements. In some jurisdictions, Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) applies to amounts over $5,000.

- Legal Basis: This is not merely an internal policy but a requirement based on FATF recommendations and local financial authority regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and tax evasion.

- Fast Processing: While this process may seem strict, it acts as a safeguard for both parties. MIM utilizes dedicated teams and automated systems to ensure these verifications are processed quickly, minimizing any potential payout delays.`,

    category: `Partners`,
    question: `What penalties will be imposed for false advertising?`,
    answer: `False advertising is regarded as one of the most serious violations in the global brokerage industry, and severe sanctions are imposed immediately upon detection.

[Key Penalties and Actions]
- Immediate Termination and Forfeiture: If an IB is found to be engaging in false or misleading advertising, MIM may terminate the contract immediately. Additionally, accrued earnings will be confiscated, and the IB will be added to an internal blacklist, preventing future partnerships.

- Legal and Regulatory Sanctions: Beyond contractual breaches, false advertising is considered "investor deception." It may be reported to financial regulators, potentially leading to fines, business bans, or other legal consequences.

- Prevention and Obligations: To mitigate these risks, MIM operates a strict pre- approval system for marketing activities. IBs are required to provide only accurate and transparent information and must strictly adhere to official guidelines to ensure long- term business continuity.`,

    question: `What are the termination conditions for an IB contract?`,
    answer: `While IB contracts are generally maintained on a perpetual basis, MIM may terminate the agreement under certain conditions to ensure market order and regulatory compliance.

[Key Termination Conditions]
- Inactivity: The contract may be terminated if there is no record of new client acquisition or if recruited clients generate little to no trading activity for an extended period.

- Compliance Breach: Immediate termination will occur in cases of false advertising, unauthorized marketing in restricted regions, AML violations, or offering unapproved rebates.

- Breach of Trust & Underperformance: Unauthorized collection of client data, interference with client funds, or failure to meet the minimum performance requirements specified in the contract over a long period are also grounds for termination.`,

    question: `Are IB earnings based on client trading volume, or on spreads/commissions?`,
    answer: `Most brokers, including MIM, calculate IB earnings based on the spreads (bid- ask difference) or trading commissions incurred during client trades. Consequently, as client trading volume increases, the total commission paid to the IB grows proportionally.

[Main Revenue Models]
- Spread- Based Model: A portion of the spread generated from each client trade is paid to the IB. This is typically applied to Standard accounts.

- Commission- Based Model: For accounts with raw spreads (e.g., ECN), the IB shares a portion of the trading commission paid by the client.

- Relation to Volume: Regardless of the model, the key drivers are trading frequency and volume. Income is maximized not just by the number of sign- ups, but by the activity level of trading clients, ensuring a transparent revenue structure.`,

    question: `Can a client change their IB if they want to?`,
    answer: `Yes, at MIM, clients are permitted to apply for an IB change. This policy respects the client's freedom to seek better services or support. However, specific restrictions apply to ensure fairness.

[Conditions and Procedures for Change]
- Restrictions: If a client has already received bonuses or rebates, the change may be restricted for a certain period to prevent the abuse of benefits (e.g., double dipping).

- Approval Process: A change is not processed automatically upon request. It must undergo an official review by MIM to prevent duplicate rebates and maintain market order.

- Waiting Period: Please be aware that a mandatory waiting period may apply after initial registration, during which IB changes are not permitted.`,

    question: `What incentives are provided for long- term active IBs?`,

[Key Incentives and Benefits]

    question: `Does IB registration involve any costs?`,
    answer: `Registering as an IB with MIM is entirely free of charge. We view IBs as valuable business partners who contribute to revenue growth and market expansion, not as entities that pay fees to participate.

[Cost Policy and Support]
- No Initial Cost: There are no sign- up fees or registration charges. You can start your partnership immediately after submitting basic documents and passing the internal approval process.

- Partner Support: To help partners succeed quickly, we provide free marketing materials, training programs, and client management tools, thereby minimizing entry barriers.

- Exceptions: However, if your local jurisdiction requires specific licenses or tax registrations for IB activities, any associated administrative costs must be borne by the partner.`,

    question: `Can an IB directly view the trading history of their referred clients?`,
    answer: `No. In compliance with industry standards and data protection regulations (such as GDPR), IBs generally cannot access the detailed trading history of their clients, including specific positions, order records, or P&L details.

[Scope of Access and Privacy Reasons]
- Access Restrictions: To protect client privacy, IBs are restricted from viewing sensitive investment details, such as specific instruments traded, entry/exit times, or trading strategies.

- Visible Information: The information provided to IBs is limited to "aggregated data" necessary for tracking marketing performance. This typically includes account activity status (Active/Inactive), total trading volume, and accrued commissions.

- Principle of Separation: Allowing IBs to view granular trading records could lead to privacy breaches or unfair inducement practices. Therefore, MIM retains sole responsibility for managing detailed trade data, while IBs are granted access only to metrics relevant to their business performance.`,

    question: `Can MIM IBs operate globally?`,
    answer: `The MIM IB program generally allows for global operations without border restrictions. Partners can leverage online marketing and networks to recruit clients from around the world. However, activities are restricted in certain jurisdictions.

[Scope of Global Operations]
- Global Scalability: You can target potential clients worldwide regardless of your physical location, maximizing your client pool. Adopting strategies tailored to local languages and cultures can further enhance performance.

- Restricted Regions: Marketing and operational activities are strictly prohibited in heavily regulated jurisdictions such as the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and parts of the EU, in compliance with international financial laws and AML standards.

- Mandatory Verification: To ensure stable revenue and legal compliance, partners must verify MIM’s "Permitted and Restricted Countries List" before commencing any activities.`,

    question: `Are IB- exclusive seminars or webinars provided?`,

    answer: `Yes. MIM operates special bonus promotions to encourage new client acquisition and support partners during the early stages of their activity.

[Bonus System Features]
- Performance Incentives: We offer various benefits to boost early growth, such as a one- time bonus for referring your first 10 clients or increased rebate rates upon reaching specific trading volumes within a set period.

- Tiered Reward Structure: We apply a tiered system where bonus amounts increase progressively as you reach milestones (e.g., 10, 50, 100 clients), helping partners stay motivated for long- term expansion.

- Promotional Nature: These bonuses act as an additional revenue stream on top of regular rebates. Since they are often temporary campaigns, we recommend checking announcements regularly to take advantage of them.`,

    question: `Is IB commission paid even if the client incurs a loss?`,
    answer: `Yes, absolutely. IB commissions are paid based solely on trading activity, regardless of whether the client makes a profit or a loss.

[Payment Principles and Reasons]
- Payment Basis: Commission is derived from the spread or transaction fees generated when a trade is executed. Therefore, payments are made as long as trades occur, irrespective of the client's trading outcome.

- Stability of Income: IB revenue is volume- based rather than performance- based. This ensures predictable and stable income that grows with client activity, rather than fluctuating with market performance.

- Fairness and Standards: This structure prevents conflicts of interest. By keeping revenue independent of client P/L, IBs can focus on their role as neutral partners connecting clients to MIM, adhering to global financial industry standards.`,
