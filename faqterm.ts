[Detailed Comparison of Order Types]
- Pending Order: An instruction to execute a trade once the market reaches a price you specify in advance. This ensures entry at your desired price, though execution is not guaranteed if the price is never reached.

- Market Order: An order executed immediately at the best available current market price. This allows for instant entry but may result in slippage during high market volatility.

[How to Set Your Order]
1. Open the order window on the MIM WebTrader or MT5 platform.

2. Select the [Order Type] section.

3. Choose [Market] for instant execution.
